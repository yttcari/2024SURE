This project is done in 2024 Summer Undergraduate Research Exchange (SURE) programme. 
The aim of this project is to apply SPO2023 electron model in to ray tracing code `ipole`. 
It is then used to test for the Sgr A* constraints and predict the images of ngEHT radio-quiet active galactic nuclei targets.
